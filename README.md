# PythonVulnerabilityScanner
# This is a scanner that checks for vulnerabilities in Python packages that are installed on your system.

This is a basic vulnerability scanner that checks installed software versions against a list of software versions that contain a known vulnerability. This can be useful for systems where the software packages are managed through common pacakge managers like 'pip' for Python packages.

-We use the modules 'subprocess' and 'json'
-The code then retrieves a list of installed packages
-Next the code will check against known vulnerabilities that are listed in the code, this is also where users can add to the list to widen the vulnerabilities that it checks for.
-Then it scans for the vulnerabilities and will let you know if there are vulnerabilities found, if there are it will list what was found, if not it will print 'No vulnerabilities found.'
